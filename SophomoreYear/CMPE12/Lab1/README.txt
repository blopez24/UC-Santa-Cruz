What did you learn in this lab?
In this lab I learned plenty about MultiMedia Logic. I learned about the following components: input switches, wires, circuits, gates, signal sender devices, and signal devices. Starting Lab 1 I did not know how to make a simple circuit worked, much less how to use only NAND gates and NOR gates. Everything was new to me, and I learned so much along the way, such as connecting wires to gates to send signals and using gates to represent a SOP/POS. I learned how to work with certain tools and integrate it with a truth table, LED, and 8 Segment LED Device.

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
Reading the tutorial, made me understand how certain components worked and interact with each other. Thinking about the process before touch any component made the lab easier to solve. Creating a truth table, getting the SOP/POS from it, simplifying further, and turning it to a logical expression helped solve parts B and C. After doing this, I then started connecting wires to gates and signal devices. I did not encounter any issues. 

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
Learn how to make all the wires straight while using snap to grid. When I used snap to grid, some wires would not stay straight.
