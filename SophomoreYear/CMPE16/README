CMPE16: Applied Discrete Mathematics

Date:
Fall 2018

Description:
Introduction to applications of discrete mathematical systems. Topics include sets, functions, relations, graphs, predicate calculus, mathematical proof methods (induction, contraposition, contradiction), counting methods (permutations, combinations), and recurrences. Examples are drawn from computer science and computer engineering. Knowledge of computer programming is useful before taking this course. Students who do not have prior programing experience are strongly recommended to take Computer Science 5C, 5J, or 5P before taking this course. Prerequisite(s): Mathematics 19A or 11B or Applied Mathematics and Statistics 11B or 15B or Economics 11B. (General Education Code(s): MF, Q.)
