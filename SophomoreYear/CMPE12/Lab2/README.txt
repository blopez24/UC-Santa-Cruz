------------------------- 
What were the learning objectives of this lab?
To apply the knowledge presented in class by
building more complex circuits using 
combinational and sequential logic. To build a
logic to implement Whack-A-Mole. To determine
if the mole is successfully whacked, keep track
of the score, and modify the score according to
the rules. 

What was your design approach? 
Tackle each part one at a time. I first
decided to complete the 4-bit adder, then try to
construct the 4-bit register. After attempting
to construct both, I moved onto linking them.  

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
I encountered many issues with my lab2. I had to
rebuild my 4-bit adder to allow for subtraction.
I was able to get the 4 bit adder to work after
the third attempt, however I could not figure out
how to get the 4-bit register to work. The 4-bit
register was not able to store add onto the data.
It was only able to store the data that was on.
I enjoyed making the 4-bit adder. After completing
the 4-bit adder, I had a better understanding of
it. 

How would you redesign this lab assignment to make it better?
I would get it to work and make it visually
cleaner.
