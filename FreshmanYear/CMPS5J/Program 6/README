# Description:  At the beginning it displays a rocket at the center of the sketchpad.
#               To increase thrust on the rocket, move mouse to top half of sketchpad.
#               To decrease thrust on the rocket, move mouse to bottom half of sketchpad.
#               To control positioning of rocket, use left and right arrow keys.
#               The rocket will explode if you crash into the mountain.
#               The rocket will explode if you land at too high of a horizontal or vertical velocity on the launchad.
#               The rocket will explode if you attempt to land on the nose cone of the rocket.
#               The fuel gague will deplete more as you increase the thrust.
#               After the rocket fuel runs out, you will have a limited amount of time before the oxygen in the spaceship runs out.
#               Everyone inside the spaceship will die, if the rocket runs out of oxygen after all fuel is expended.

# Notes:        This program is intended to be run from the Processing IDE.
