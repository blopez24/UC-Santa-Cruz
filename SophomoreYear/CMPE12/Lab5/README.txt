-------------------------
What was your design approach?
I read the decription boxes of each subroutines and tried to fully understand it before typing. I
then solve each subroutine one at a time; Going in order.

What did you learn in this lab?
I learned and got confomfortable using stacks. I learned a lot about stacks and how useful they are
storing register values. This allowed me to repeat registers without loosing the data in them.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
I did not encounter any major issues. There was some debugging to be done, but it was easy to 
resolve. The small issues didn't cause any headaches. I enjoyed all parts in this lab. It was 
interesting having the subroutines given to use. It allowed me to see how the person who created 
the lab would go about solving it.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would probably make it more efficient. I am proud of my simple but elegant solution for 
check_ascii. I wish to make my other subroutines like it.

Did you collaborate with anyone on this lab? Please list who you collaborated
I did not collaborate with anyone on this lab. All work was done by me.
